🌿 Composite
-----------------

Real world example
> Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.

In plain words
> Composite pattern lets clients to treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our employees example from above. Here we have different employee types

```php

interface Employee {
    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary);
    public function getName() : string;
    public function setSalary(float $salary);
    public function getSalary() : float;
    public function getRoles()  : array;
}

class Developer implements Employee {

    protected $salary;
    protected $name;

    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getName() : string {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setSalary(float $salary) {
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getSalary() : float {
        return $this->salary;
    }

    public function getRoles() : array {
        return $this->roles;
    }
}

class Designer implements Employee {

    protected $salary;
    protected $name;

    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getName() : string {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setSalary(float $salary) {
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getSalary() : float {
        return $this->salary;
    }

    public function getRoles() : array {
        return $this->roles;
    }
}
```

Then we have an organization which consists of several different types of employees

```php
class Organization {
    
    protected $employees;

    public function addEmployee(Employee $employee) {
        $this->employees[] = $employee;
    }

    public function getNetSalaries() : float {
        $netSalary = 0;

        foreach ($this->employees as $employee) {
            $netSalary += $employee->getSalary();
        }

        return $netSalary;
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```php
// Prepare the employees
$john = new Developer('John Doe', 12000);
$jane = new Designer('Jane', 10000);

// Add them to organization
$organization = new Organization();
$organization->addEmployee($john);
$organization->addEmployee($jane);

echo "Net salaries: " . $organization->getNetSalaries(); // Net Salaries: 22000
```
