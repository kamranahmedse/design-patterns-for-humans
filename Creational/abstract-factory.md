🔨 Abstract Factory
----------------

Real world example
> Extending our door example from Simple Factory. Based on your needs you might get a wooden door from a wooden door shop, iron door from an iron shop or a PVC door from the relevant shop. Plus you might need a guy with different kind of specialities to fit the door, for example a carpenter for wooden door, welder for iron door etc. As you can see there is a dependency between the doors now, wooden door needs carpenter, iron door needs a welder etc.

In plain words
> A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes. 
  
Wikipedia says
> The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

**Programmatic Example**

Translating the door example above. First of all we have our `Door` interface and some implementation for it

```php
interface Door {
    public function getDescription();
}

class WoodenDoor implements Door {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I am a wooden door';
    }
}

class IronDoor implements Door {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I am an iron door';
    }
}
```
Then we have some fitting experts for each door type

```php
interface DoorFittingExpert {
    public function getDescription();
}

class Welder implements DoorFittingExpert {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I can only fit iron doors';
    }
}

class Carpenter implements DoorFittingExpert {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I can only fit wooden doors';
    }
}
```

Now we have our abstract factory that would let us make family of related objects i.e. wooden door factory would create a wooden door and wooden door fitting expert and iron door factory would create an iron door and iron door fitting expert
```php
interface DoorFactory {
    public function makeDoor() : Door;
    public function makeFittingExpert() : DoorFittingExpert;
}

// Wooden factory to return carpenter and wooden door
class WoodenDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
    public function makeDoor() : Door {
        return new WoodenDoor();
    }

    public function makeFittingExpert() : DoorFittingExpert{
        return new Carpenter();
    }
}

// Iron door factory to get iron door and the relevant fitting expert
class IronDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
    public function makeDoor() : Door {
        return new IronDoor();
    }

    public function makeFittingExpert() : DoorFittingExpert{
        return new Welder();
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
$woodenFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory();

$door = $woodenFactory->makeDoor();
$expert = $woodenFactory->makeFittingExpert();

$door->getDescription();  // Output: I am a wooden door
$expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit wooden doors

// Same for Iron Factory
$ironFactory = new IronDoorFactory();

$door = $ironFactory->makeDoor();
$expert = $ironFactory->makeFittingExpert();

$door->getDescription();  // Output: I am an iron door
$expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit iron doors
```

As you can see the wooden door factory has encapsulated the `carpenter` and the `wooden door` also iron door factory has encapsulated the `iron door` and `welder`. And thus it had helped us make sure that for each of the created door, we do not get a wrong fitting expert.   

**When to use?**

When there are interrelated dependencies with not-that-simple creation logic involved
